# Useful blocks for trust theme

👉🏼 This is a block plugin for users of the trust theme. You must have trust theme installed as most of the visual styles are theme dependent.

💡 In near future I plan to make this a general plugin, add more bells and whistles to it, and make it available on WordPress plugin directory.

## Installation

- clone the repo in your plugins folder
  
  or
